## Repo Info

The `jsx-email` repository uses  [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/). `pnpm` is used for package management. We also assume that you have Node.js installed.

### Getting Started

If you're new to `pnpm` you'll want to run `npm add pnpm -g` first. It will install everything you'll need to get started.

Next we'll want to get dependencies installed, and get everything built:

```console
$ pnpm install
```

Then build all the things:

```console
$ pnpm build
```

## Before Committing

1. Use at least Node.js v18.0.0 or higher. [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) can be handy for switching between Node versions.
1. Lint your changes via `pnpm lint`. Fix any errors and warnings before committing.
1. Test your changes via `pnpm test`. Only Pull Requests with passing tests will be accepted.

## Submitting Code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. Our guidelines for Pull Requests:

- Please fill in our template in its entirety. Please don't reformat it or modify it
- The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it
- The pull request should also contain tests
- Before submitting your Pull Request, please lint your changes by running `pnpm lint` in the root directory
- If any checks fail for your Pull Request, please resolve them. Always feel free to ask for help if unable to resolve issues with checks

## Code Review Process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.

It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you? Does it resolve any known Github issues? Adding a line "resolves #&lt;issue number&gt;" (e.g. "resolves #23") to the description of your pull request or of a specific commit will automatically close this issue once the pull request is merged.
